This project is from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

When I am done I will come back and reflect on a few things that I learned.

## Order of Operations
I used the order of operations that are published by Wolfram (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Precedence.html):
1. Parenthesis
2. Factorial
3. Exponentiation
4. Multiplication and division
5. Addition and subtraction
